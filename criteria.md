# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1.

<!-- Your criterion. It must name a number. -->

In each of three evaluation trials, no more than 1 of 10 pieces I wrote myself
will receive the `ai` guess.

**Why this target:**

A false accusation can harm a writer more than a missed AI-written passage
harms the site. Allowing one error recognizes that the signals are imperfect,
while keeping the acceptable false-positive rate low.

---

## 2.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

In each trial, the median `combined_score` for five clearly AI-generated
samples will be at least 0.20 higher than the median score for five
clearly human-written samples.

**Why this target:**

A measurable gap shows that the scores distinguish these two groups at least
somewhat, without pretending that any one score proves authorship. Using the
median makes the target less dependent on one unusually high or low sample.

---

## 3.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

In each trial, the evaluation set will produce at least one `human`, one
`unsure`, and one `ai` guess.

**Why this target:**

All three outcomes need to be reachable for the labels to be useful. If a
label never appears, the thresholds or the signals are not giving readers the
range of outcomes the service promises.

---

## 4.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

For three valid appeals against existing content IDs, all three requests will
return `200`, append an appeal entry with status `under_review`, and leave the
original decision entry unchanged.

**Why this target:**

A writer needs a reliable way to challenge a mistaken result. Keeping the
original decision and recording every appeal makes the review history
auditable rather than silently replacing the first result.

---

## 5.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

Missing, null, empty, whitespace-only, and over-100,000-character `text`
inputs will each return `400` or `413`—never `500`—and each rejected request
will leave a rejection entry in the audit log.

**Why this target:**

Malformed or excessively large input should not crash the service or disappear
without a trace. A clear client error tells the caller what happened, and the
log makes repeated failures diagnosable.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
